# HIERARCHICAL-CLUSTERING

### IMPLEMENTION OF HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT INCOME SPENT

- Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, which is used to group the unlabeled datasets into a cluster and also known as hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA
- In this algorithm, we develop the hierarchy of clusters in the form of a tree, and this tree-shaped structure is known as the dendrogram
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and the output is predicted
- Finally, the predicted output is visualized
